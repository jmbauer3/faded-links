I don't know what I'll use this for...
can you believe he did that?
Does anybody else still make new friends?
It feels a little lonely here
I don't remember when I stopped calling back
using punctuation is cringe
The food tastes a off. I think they added something new.
When I was younger, I thought I would do more.
Success is a function of luck and preperation. 
Be ready and opportunity will find you!
motivation is a scam and anyone who buys in knows that
I didn't choose to be born.
When exactly did social media stop being social?
The transformation from individual personality to personal brand has been dehumanizing
I'm just screaming into the void.
Was there anything worth saying or do I just want to be heard?
Nothing but noise
Sometimes I wonder how many people I've passed by, seeing them for the last time in both our lives.
It feels empty
Are you afraid?
The chef's choice was a surprise! 
I don't know if it was a good one
Test, test, test. Hello? Is this thing on?
If I didn't have to worry, I wouldn't
Who actually cares about the person they're congratulating?
Why would I bother coming up with original content?
Our value as people is tied to our wealth as salary.
Would you still post if no one liked or commented?
I think they might be on to me...
A few more tests and I'll know for sure.
I always wanted to learn a new language, but I never can never find the time
What are we going to do if everything gets worse?
The destruction of corporate creation does not devalue self-expression, but it doess destroy art as a commercial commodity and perhaps a stable career.
If I don't fit in, where should I go?
What day is today again?
It's already Thursday!
I knew they were adding something strange to the food!
There's a sick joke in how skill isn't as important as personality
Understanding is one thing, practicing is another.
I forget why I thought anyone would care.
Why am I still awake?
I sure hope the data is annonymized or at the very least randomized
If you're reading this it's too late.
I love you
I never knew what to say
Goodbye World
Can you believe I bothered to come up with individual comments?
Muah! Voila! Bon appetit!
another traffic jam
GET INFORMED!!!!!
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
all my dreams died so long ago
ax2 + bx + c = 0
The machine is actually better than us. I don't know how that makes me feel.
What makes a thing human IS the imperfection
Sloppiness is ugly, but so are we
The past is gone and I don't know where it went
I find myself going back to the same apps, hoping they'll magically keep me entertained
I forgot how to find my own happiness after the algorithm learned to keep me sated
Comfortably numb or paralyzed by choice?
Is there anybody out there?
DONT TELL ME WHAT I CANT DO
Sometimes the references are lost
I only wanted you to know I cared.
Is it authentic if it's how I feel?
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP
I drank too much last night
with the idea of an era replacing a fad, the expectation to keep up is accelerated
I was just trying to give you a range...
all i really wanted to say was that you don't know what you're talking about
will the screams ever stop
I might have some *vague* news
I don't care who hears this
Wouldn't you like to know?
What the hell is wrong with this country?
Do you still watch the news?
Have you ever been to Disneyworld?
NO U
lol
upvotes to the left my good sir!
memes went from lasting for years to lasting for hours in less than two decades.
if you're doing other people's work, people don't think you're doing a good job, they think you're a sucker
Hey everyone! I'm new here and just trying to figure out how to fit in!
I'm leaving this place.
We need to be more welcoming to newcomers!
Buzz off!
oops autocorrect
I don't know if I feel things anymore
She was my whole world.
I LOVE THIS SONG
2b or not 2b, there is no question
neo was still in the matrix, that's why he could control the machines
Individual experience is so valued that spoilers have no real experiration date. I could see someone getting mad at you for "spoiling" Plato's Republic. They wouldn't necessarily be wrong to their individual experience, but it does feel a little absurd.
No one cares
Brands posting like "regular people" on popular content went from somewhat novel to over-the-top really fast. It's not cool and is just more advertising invading another one of our spaces.
Advertisers unironically like VR for the potential of full field of view ads. Although people seem to be over the whole AR and VR wave.

For 100 We Try Harder
Ee
I’ve rewatched this 10 times now.
Who even checks notifications anymore?
I didn’t think I’d miss it, but I do.
Why do I feel like I’m always waiting for something?
The sky was prettier yesterday.
Not all who wander are lost, but I am.
When did I become so tired?
Don’t you hate it when your mind won’t shut up?
They told me to calm down. I didn’t listen.
This coffee isn’t strong enough.
I wish I could go back.
Is it weird to miss someone you’ve never met?
I was hoping for more.
There’s something so eerie about silence.
Guess I’ll just keep scrolling.
Why do I even bother getting notifications?
I forgot what I was going to say...
Sometimes I wonder if we’re all pretending.
Do you ever feel like you’re floating through life?
There’s no undo button here.
I used to believe in things.
I can’t believe it’s already been three years.
I miss the rain.
I wish I cared more about things.
This feels like the beginning of the end.
Everything feels temporary.
I never thought it would hurt this much.
I thought things would be different by now.
Do you ever wish you could disappear for a while?
If you’ve never been sad at 3 a.m., are you really living?
I think I’m starting to lose touch with reality.
How many times can someone break before they’re truly broken?
What if none of this is real?
Why is it always the things we love that hurt us the most?
I was here before it was cool.
Guess I’ll try again tomorrow.
I feel like I’m losing my mind.
This was a mistake.
The stars don’t look the same anymore.
I thought we had more time.
I used to laugh more.
What’s the point of it all?
Is anyone even paying attention?
I thought I’d be happy by now.
I keep waiting for something to change.
What if we never figure it out?
I could really use a nap.
I keep going back to places that hurt me.
You ever just stare at the ceiling for hours?
I don’t recognize myself anymore.
I wish I had more time.
I can’t believe this is happening.
Do you ever feel like everyone’s watching you?
Sometimes, I forget what it feels like to be happy.
I wish things were different.
I keep waiting for someone to understand.
Everything feels like it’s happening too fast.
What if this is as good as it gets?
I wonder if I’ll ever feel okay again.
I miss how things used to be.
When did we stop caring?
There’s something so peaceful about being alone.
I wish I could stay in bed all day.
Do you ever feel like you’re not enough?
I’m not even sure what I’m feeling anymore.
Sometimes, I just want to scream.
What are we even doing here?
I wish I could just shut my brain off.
I think I’ve forgotten how to relax.
I’m so tired of being tired.
This is not what I signed up for.
Maybe tomorrow will be better.
I miss being a kid.
Why does everything feel so hard now?
Is this all there is?
I don’t think I belong here.
When did everything become so complicated?
I’m not sure I know who I am anymore.
I keep trying, but nothing ever changes.
I think I’m going to lose it.
Sometimes, I just want to run away.
What if none of this matters?
I’m starting to feel like a stranger in my own life.
I never thought it would be this hard.
Why do I keep doing this to myself?
I miss when things were simpler.
I wish I could go back and start over.
I’m scared of what the future holds.
I don’t think anyone really knows me.
I feel like I’m drowning.
Do you ever just feel... off?
I’m so tired of pretending everything is okay.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt this lost.
I wish I could hit pause on life.
Why is it so hard to just be happy?
I don’t think I’m ever going to figure it out.
I feel like I’m falling apart.
I wonder what it’s like to feel content.
It’s always the quiet ones.
I think I’m scared of being happy.
What if this is all a dream?
I feel like I’m always chasing something I can’t reach.
I’m not sure what I’m doing anymore.
Sometimes, I feel like I’m just going through the motions.
I wonder if anyone notices when I’m gone.
I used to know what I wanted.
Do you ever feel like you’re not in control of your own life?
I miss when I didn’t overthink everything.
I thought I’d have it all figured out by now.
I’m starting to feel invisible.
Do you ever feel like you’re running out of time?
Sometimes, I wonder if it’s all just a big joke.
I can’t believe how much things have changed.
I’m not sure where I’m headed, but I’m going.
Do you ever feel like you’re stuck in a loop?
I miss when things were easy.
I wish I could forget everything.
I feel like I’m always one step behind.
Why does everything feel so heavy?
I’m not sure I belong here anymore.
I wonder what’s on the other side.
I feel like I’m fading away.
I’m scared of being forgotten.
I think I’m going to cry.
Do you ever feel like you’re living someone else’s life?
I can’t believe how fast time is flying by.
I wish I could just stop thinking for a while.
Why do I always feel like I’m not enough?
I feel like I’m always searching for something I’ll never find.
I wish I could hit the reset button.
I wonder if anyone else feels like this.
I can’t keep doing this.
I think I’ve lost myself.
Do you ever feel like you’re just... existing?
I thought I had more time.
I miss when life was simple.
I wonder if things will ever get better.
I feel like I’m running out of chances.
Sometimes, I wonder if I’m the problem.
I wish I could just disappear for a while.
I’m not sure I’m cut out for this.
Why does everything feel so overwhelming?
I miss when things didn’t hurt this much.
I feel like I’m always waiting for something to go wrong.
I wish I could just turn my brain off.
Do you ever feel like you’re missing something?
I’m not sure I know how to be happy anymore.
I wonder what it’s like to not care.
I can’t believe this is my life.
I feel like I’m always on edge.
I miss the old me.
Sometimes, I just want to scream into the void.
I wish I could go back to when things were easier.
I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do now.
I feel like I’m always waiting for something to happen.
I wish I knew how to stop overthinking everything.
I miss when things were simple.
I’m scared of what comes next.
I don’t think I’m okay.
I wish I could just hit pause.
I feel like I’m running out of time.
I’m not sure I’m ready for this.
I wish I could go back and do things differently.
I’m so tired of feeling like this.
I feel like I’m always falling behind.
I wish I could just stop thinking for a while.

I feel like I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop.
I wish I could just disappear for a while.
I’m scared of what the future holds.
I miss when things were easy.
I’m not sure I belong here anymore.
I wonder if things will ever get better.
I wish I could just hit the reset button.
I feel like I’m always chasing something I can’t reach.
I miss when I didn’t overthink everything.

Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.
I am ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party and I attended with my real face

Cacheing makes it so hard to troubleshoot
