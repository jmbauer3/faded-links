I don't know what I'll use this for...
can you believe he did that?
Does anybody else still make new friends?
It feels a little lonely here
I don't remember when I stopped calling back
using punctuation is cringe
The food tastes a off. I think they added something new.
When I was younger, I thought I would do more.
Success is a function of luck and preperation. 
Be ready and opportunity will find you!
motivation is a scam and anyone who buys in knows that
Guess where we are!
When exactly did social media stop being social?
The transformation from individual personality to personal brand has been dehumanizing
I'm just screaming into the void.
Was there anything worth saying or do I just want to be heard?
Nothing but noise
Sometimes I wonder how many people I've passed by, seeing them for the last time in both our lives.
It feels empty
Are you afraid?
The chef's choice was a surprise! 
I don't know if it was a good one
Test, test, test. Hello? Is this thing on?
If I didn't have to worry, I wouldn't
Who actually cares about the person they're congratulating?
Why would I bother coming up with original content?
Our value as people is tied to our wealth as salary.
Would you still post if no one liked or commented?
I think they might be on to me...
A few more tests and I'll know for sure.
I always wanted to learn a new language, but I never can never find the time
What are we going to do if everything gets worse?
The destruction of corporate creation does not devalue self-expression, but it doess destroy art as a commercial commodity and perhaps a stable career.

What day is today again?
It's already Thursday!
I knew they were adding something strange to the food!
There's a sick joke in how skill isn't as important as personality
Understanding is one thing, practicing is another.
I forget why I thought anyone would care.
Why am I still awake?
I sure hope the data is annonymized or at the very least randomized
If you're reading this it's too late.
I love you
I never knew what to say
Goodbye World
Can you believe I bothered to come up with individual comments?
Muah! Voila! Bon appetit!
another traffic jam
GET INFORMED!!!!!
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?
all my dreams died so long ago
ax2 + bx + c = 0
The machine is actually better than us. I don't know how that makes me feel.
What makes a thing human IS the imperfection
Sloppiness is ugly, but so are we
The past is gone and I don't know where it went
I find myself going back to the same apps, hoping they'll magically keep me entertained
I forgot how to find my own happiness after the algorithm learned to keep me sated
Comfortably numb or paralyzed by choice?
Is there anybody out there?
DONT TELL ME WHAT I CANT DO
Sometimes the references are lost
I only wanted you to know I cared.
Is it authentic if it's how I feel?
SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP
I drank too much last night
with the idea of an era replacing a fad, the expectation to keep up is accelerated
I was just trying to give you a range...
all i really wanted to say was that you don't know what you're talking about
will the screams ever stop
I might have some *vague* news
I don't care who hears this
Wouldn't you like to know?
What the hell is wrong with this country?
Do you still watch the news?
Have you ever been to Disneyworld?
NO U
lol
upvotes to the left my good sir!
memes went from lasting for years to lasting for hours in less than two decades.
if you're doing other people's work, people don't think you're doing a good job, they think you're a sucker
Hey everyone! I'm new here and just trying to figure out how to fit in!
I'm leaving this place.
We need to be more welcoming to newcomers!
Buzz off!
oops autocorrect
I don't know if I feel things anymore
She was my whole world.
I LOVE THIS SONG
2b or not 2b, there is no question
neo was still in the matrix, that's why he could control the machines
Individual experience is so valued that spoilers have no real experiration date. I could see someone getting mad at you for "spoiling" Plato's Republic. They wouldn't necessarily be wrong to their individual experience, but it does feel a little absurd.
No one cares
Brands posting like "regular people" on popular content went from somewhat novel to over-the-top really fast. It's not cool and is just more advertising invading another one of our spaces.
Advertisers unironically like VR for the potential of full field of view ads. Although people seem to be over the whole AR and VR wave.

For 100 We Try Harder
Ee
Just binged this for the third time—no regrets!
Notifications? Are those still a thing?
Surprisingly, this brings back memories.
Always waiting for the next big thing.
Yesterday's sunset was unbeatable.
Wandering feels right sometimes.
When did fatigue become a lifestyle?
Ever notice how the mind races at night?
They said chill, but did anyone listen?
Is it too early for another cup?
Nostalgia hits differently these days.
Missing faces in a sea of profiles.
Hopes were high; expectations were low.
Silence can be unsettling.
Scrolling feels like a reflex now.
Notifications feel like background noise.
What was the point of that again?
Sometimes, the show feels scripted.
Floating through life sounds exhausting.
Once something’s done, there’s no going back.
Beliefs have shifted over time.
Has it really been three years?
Where’s the rain when you need it?
Why does caring feel so taxing?
This vibe feels like an ending.
Everything’s temporary, isn’t it?
Pain often takes unexpected forms.
Time is a tricky companion.
Disappearing seems tempting sometimes.
Late-night thoughts are a different kind of alive.
What if nothing is real anymore?
Love can be a double-edged sword.
Here before the hype became real.
Tomorrow brings another chance, right?
Mind racing in circles feels all too familiar.
Choices can feel like mistakes in hindsight.
Stars just don’t shine like they used to.
Thought we had more moments left.
Laughter seems like a distant memory.
What's the ultimate goal, anyway?
Am I really being seen in this noise?
Happiness feels like a moving target.
Change feels like it’s always out of reach.
Will this all ever feel right again?
Revisiting past places can sting.
Hours spent staring at the ceiling?
Who are you, really?
Time’s slipping through fingers like sand.
Reality is becoming less familiar.
Can peace be found in solitude?
A day in bed sounds like a dream.
Are we ever truly enough?
Emotions are getting harder to define.
Screaming feels like an option some days.
Why is it so hard to relax?
Just feeling a bit lost today.
Not what was expected, that’s for sure.
Tomorrow might surprise us, hopefully.
Childhood was carefree bliss.
Navigating adulthood is no small feat.
Every moment seems to carry weight.
Complexity seems to be the new normal. 
When was the last time anyone checked their notifications?
Scrolling through feeds like it's a part-time job.
Didn’t think missing a trend would feel like this.
Is it always about waiting for the next big thing?
Yesterday’s sunset was a masterpiece.
Exploration doesn’t mean losing the way.
Tired is the new normal, isn't it?
Some days, silence feels like the loudest noise.
Ever wish the coffee could just do its job?
Missing the days before the screens.
Is it strange to feel nostalgia for a stranger?
Expectations were set too high this time.
Silence can be unsettling in a crowded room.
Just keep scrolling; it’s easier that way.
Why bother checking notifications at all?
What was the point of that post again?
Are we all just playing roles online?
Floating through social feeds feels surreal sometimes.
No chance for an undo button in real life.
Beliefs used to mean something, didn’t they?
Three years can pass in the blink of an eye.
A good rain can wash away the blues.
Apathy seems to have taken over.
Is this the prologue to something bigger?
Moments of joy feel fleeting these days.
Can anyone remember what permanent feels like?
Some wounds take longer to heal than others.
There was a time when things seemed less complicated.
When did the simple things become so hard?
Do the likes mean anything anymore?
Life feels like a series of updates without meaning.
Chasing happiness shouldn't be this exhausting.
Laughter used to come easy; what changed?
Is the digital world really connecting us?
What’s on the horizon when today feels stagnant?
Days seem to slip through fingers like sand.
Time can feel like a constant echo, can’t it?
Feeling invisible among a sea of profiles.
What’s left when the laughter fades?
Fleeting moments seem to define everything now.
Lost time makes every second feel heavy.
Time flies, but where does it go?
Life is a dance of highs and lows.
Are we simply existing in this digital age?
What happens when the screen goes dark?
The quiet ones often have the loudest thoughts.
Pursuing happiness feels like a marathon sometimes.
This life feels like a never-ending scroll.
How long can someone keep pretending?
Is there such a thing as too much reflection?
Have we become our own worst critics?
Simplicity used to be a comfort; where is it now?
Everyone seems to be sharing, but who’s really listening?
Can a digital footprint lead to real connections?
Expectations can be heavy; who sets them?
Wondering if anyone notices the absence.
Life was once a straightforward path.
Did the moments we shared really matter?
Feeling like a spectator in someone else’s story.
The next post could change everything—or nothing.
What happens when the likes fade away?
Ever feel like you’re on the outside looking in?
Time to hit refresh on the daily grind.
The weight of words can linger long after they’re gone.
Curiosity can spark creativity, but is it enough?
Social media: a connection or a distraction?
What’s the cost of staying updated?
Echoes of laughter often hide the tears.
Sometimes, a break from it all is the best answer.
Digital landscapes shift so quickly; are we keeping up?
Scrolling feels like a modern-day meditation.
Is anyone else feeling the weight of silence?
Life's complexities can be overwhelming.
The present can feel like a constant replay.
Lost in a digital maze—will we find our way out?
Can stillness provide clarity in a noisy world?
Is there beauty in the mundane?
Chasing moments instead of followers.
Finding comfort in the small things.
Happiness feels more like a choice than a guarantee.
Can anyone relate to the pressure of perfection?
Hashtags can’t capture real emotions.
Sometimes the silence is louder than the noise.
Do we even remember what makes us happy?
Wondering if life is meant to be this complicated.
Sharing is easy; understanding is the hard part.
A pause in the chaos can be refreshing.
Do trends really define us?
Reflections in a feed can be deceiving.
What if today is just a warm-up?
Feeling the urge to disconnect for a while.
A moment of clarity can come from the strangest places.
Finding joy in the little things feels revolutionary.
Sometimes, it’s okay to just be.
The right words can change a moment.
Social media: a window or a mirror?
What if we all just took a break?
In a world of noise, finding silence is golden.
Time spent online can feel both enriching and draining.
Every post tells a story, but what’s the real narrative?
There’s freedom in authenticity, even online.
Do we engage to connect or to escape?
How many times can we reinvent ourselves?
Sometimes the bravest thing is just being yourself.
Is anyone else tired of the same old posts?
Taking a step back can bring new perspective.
Is it really about the likes or the moments?
Finding the extraordinary in the ordinary is a gift.

Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.

you are alone, Chinaski, and below the stage the seats are empty. the theatre is dark. why do you keep acting? what a bad habit
Cacheing makes it so hard to troubleshoot
Why does every bug decide to show up right before a deadline? It's like they have a calendar.
Spent three hours debugging just to realize I was missing a damn semicolon. Classic.
Client: “Can you just add this small feature?” Me: “Sure, let me rewrite half my code for you.”
My code runs perfectly in development, but in production? It crashes like it’s auditioning for a disaster movie.
Why do I always forget to commit before pulling? It’s like clockwork at this point.
When the documentation says “simple,” but it turns into a week-long nightmare. Thanks for that.
Spent an entire day fixing one issue, only for three more to rear their ugly heads. This job is a joke.
Why do we always underestimate how long anything will take? It’s like we’re asking for disappointment.
I miss when coding was about writing code, not wrestling with frameworks.
Yesterday’s code? Feels like it was written by a stranger. What happened?
I think I need a new keyboard; this one has too many shortcuts that just waste my time.
Just when I think I’ve mastered something, a new framework comes out to ruin my day.
It feels like I’m constantly battling against the very tools I’m supposed to use. Fantastic.
Nothing like pouring hours into a feature only for the client to say they don’t want it. Love that.
Why does my IDE crash at the worst possible moment? It’s like it’s in on the joke.
Merging branches that haven’t been touched in months? A developer’s favorite pastime.
Why do bugs only show up on Fridays? It’s like they have a vendetta against the weekend.
Fixing one bug is just an invitation for two more to pop up. Thanks for that lovely surprise.
Why do people think coding is just typing? It’s more like solving a never-ending maze.
The most frustrating part of coding? Vague error messages that lead nowhere. Brilliant design.
I love when I finally grasp a concept… only for them to change it the next day.
Can someone explain why I can’t reproduce the bug on my local machine? It's infuriating.
If I see one more vague comment in the code, I might just lose it. Seriously, it’s not that hard.
Spent a week optimizing code, and the performance barely budged. What a waste of time.
Why do developers say “it’s just a quick fix” when they know damn well it won’t be?
If I had a dollar for every time I said “it works on my machine,” I’d retire tomorrow.
It’s amazing how a tiny change can lead to a complete disaster. Who designs this stuff?
Why does it take forever to deploy changes but magically takes no time for new features? Hilarious.
The thrill of merging code and praying it doesn’t break is just the best part of my day.
When someone asks if I’m busy, I want to yell that I’m always busy and it’s exhausting.
Why do I keep getting caught in this endless cycle of refactoring? It’s like I’m trapped in purgatory.
The more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know. What a comforting thought.
Why does no one read the documentation until something breaks? Brilliant strategy, really.
My code is probably haunted by the ghosts of bugs past. Fantastic.
Why do I always find typos in my code right after submission? Timing couldn’t be worse.
I love how a minor change can lead to hours of relentless debugging. That’s fun, right?
Can we please stop saying “just one more feature”? It’s never just one more.
Why does every merge conflict feel like a personal attack? This job is a war zone.
The struggle of maintaining legacy code is the cherry on top of my frustration sundae.
It’s great when a code review is just a long session of nitpicking. Who needs positivity?
Why do clients think they can change specs halfway through? That’s not how this works.
The best part of development? When you finally understand the problem but still can’t fix it.
Why does every meeting seem to drag on forever? I didn’t sign up for this torture.
Spent hours implementing a solution, only to discover a simpler one after. Typical.
I never knew how much I’d miss a working printer until I needed one and it failed me.
Why do people always assume coding is magic? It’s hard work and a constant headache.
Every time I start a new project, I forget all the lessons I supposedly learned from the last one.
Why do I regret not documenting my code while I’m writing it? What a waste.
When the project manager says “just a quick update,” I know I’m in for a long, painful ride.
Why is it that I can explain the solution to others but still can’t implement it myself? What a joke.
