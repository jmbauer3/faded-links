Another day, another scroll.
What’s for dinner?
Why is the sky so blue today?
I need coffee.
Did anyone else see that?
Is this thing on?
Who even reads these?
My shoes don’t match my outfit today.
I should really be doing something else.
Why is everything so quiet all of a sudden?
Has anyone else lost track of time?
I forgot what I was going to say.
Where did everyone go?
This feels weird. Anyone else feel weird?
Sometimes I think the internet is just talking back to itself.
I'm just waiting for something to happen.
This is starting to feel like a glitch.
It's 3 AM. Why am I still here?
Does this even matter anymore?
I swear I've seen this same post before.
I keep hearing strange noises in my apartment.
I'm not sure I recognize my own reflection anymore.
The walls are breathing again.
Everything tastes like metal today.
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or awake.
Has anyone else noticed their screen flickering?
I can't stop hearing that whisper in the background.
The static is getting louder.
I saw my name in the comments, but I didn't post anything.
Something is wrong with the light. It keeps flickering.
I thought I was alone, but then I heard footsteps.
Every time I blink, the room looks different.
I can't feel my hands anymore.
It's been days, right? Or maybe hours? I can't tell.
Why does everything feel like it's slowing down?
Am I the only one seeing the shadows move?
I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
I forgot what my own voice sounds like.
There's a face in the mirror that isn't mine.
I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being watched.
Sometimes I hear someone laughing, but I’m alone.
Did the screen just flash, or am I losing it?
The walls are closer than they were before.
My clock hasn’t moved in hours.
I can see the pixels breathing.
I think I left the stove on... hours ago.
I’m afraid to look out the window. 
The sun shouldn’t be that color, right?
Does anyone else feel like they’re being followed?
The floor just creaked, and no one else is home.
I think I’ve forgotten how to leave.
